# zoomer-ipsum

You heard of lorem ipsum? Been around for ages! Why should we use millenia old words? Is our beautiful language not good enough to generate random nonsense?

Based on [lorem-ipsum](https://github.com/knicklabs/lorem-ipsum.js).  
Inspired by [lorem-hipsum](https://github.com/pbojinov/lorem-hipsum).

## Why not a fork?

You might have noticed that this repository isn't a fork of lorem-ipsum.js. I did use some of their code for fundamentals, but I plan to make significant and quite breaking changes, so I figured I'd be simpler to just do it this way. Also, I feel like they're wayy too modular with everything. You might say that's good code; I think putting 7 strings in 3 files is stupid.
